== File Upload Application

*Added updated instructions and added seed to make it easier for users learning rails based on emails received


My first ruby and rails application from scratch. This application uploads filesfrom a user and saves it on a server. 

User
* Will be able to upload, download and delete there files

Admin
*Able to see all users and delete users if required

Install all gems

'''
bundle install
'''

Setup database

'''
RAILS_ENV=development rake db:migrate
'''

Create admin user

'''
RAILS_ENV=development rake db:seed
'''




App currently uses:

1. Twitter Bootstrap for UI etc(http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
2. Devise for authentication (https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)
3. Paperclip for handling uploads
4.Annotate for detailed model info

I am still learning, so if you happen to stop by here. Please feel free to make suggestions, comments etc. Actively seeking a ruby on rails mentor, or buddy to learn with and bounce questions off every now and again.


TODO
**Write some tests
**Other fixes
